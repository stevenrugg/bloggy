# Kyte Looks to Create Autonomous Rental Car Fleet

[Kyte](https://drivekyte.com)  a San Francisco based start up who raised $30 million in series A funding,
mainly led by Park West Asset Management and Sterling Road looks to automate the rental car industry. Kyte’s
technology lays the foundation for a completely autonomous rental car industry. What does this mean for the human
employees who now work for Kyte? The startup, currently operates in 14 cities: Boston, Brooklyn, Chicago, Denver,
Ft. Lauderdale, Jersey City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York (Manhattan), Philadelphia, Portland OR, Seattle, San Francisco
& Washington DC. Kyte’s current business model has rental cars delivered on-demand using Kyte’s mobile app
(Android & iOS) or website. Delivery and Return, respectively, take place at an address of your choosing.
You can schedule Delivery and Return in 30 minutes windows. Rentals come in three classes. Economy, Sedan & SUV. 

In Seattle, Kyte operates:

## *_Economy Class Vehicles_*
- Toyota Corolla
- Nissan Sentra
- Honda CR-V

## *_Sedan Class Vehicles_*
- Dodge Charger
- Hyundai Elantra
- Kia Forte
- Chevy Malibu

## *_SUV Class Vehicles_*
- Jeep Patriot
- Jeep Compass
- Toyota RAV4

A Kyte Surfer delivers and picks up your vehicle for return.
Kyte calls their independently contracted employees ‘Kyte Surfers’.

Kyte Surfers use the instant messaging app Slack to do their work. A better UI/UX Kyte promises,
still has several months to roll my ihout. Kyte is currently hiring several frontend & backend engineers.
Hopefully they hire me too! The new Kyte app may just revolutionize the industry. Leading the way in Logistics
and Telemetrics from cars on the road, maybe we’ll see Samsara join Kyte to make fully autonomous vehicles
the reality in the US?

Personally, having worked in public safety, responding to motor vehicle accidents I am all for autonomous cars. If you take
humans out of the equation, motor vehicle accidents would happen exceedingly rarely. Kyte was founded in 2019 by [Nikolaus Volk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolaus-volk/),
[Ludwig Schoenack](https://www.linkedin.com/in/schoenack/) and [Francesco Wiedemann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francescowiedemann/). The co-owners of Kyte once worked for software giants like Google and Uber.
Awesome job guys! I’m excited to see the future of Kyte.
