# Steven Rugg

Steven Rugg live in Seattle, WA and works as a freelance software engineer. In his free time, he loves to hike, mountain climb, rock climb, spend time in nature and with his friends and family. His head and heart often tell him to take two very different paths.

He is an outspoken proponent of renewable, sustainable, clean energy and scrubbing/off-setting as much CO2 out of the atmosphere as humanly possible. Our predecessors have left us with a dire situation. You may judge one on "removable storage", however "removable storage" is now the way of the world.
